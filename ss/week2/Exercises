Exercise 2.11
The package ss.week2 and ss.week2.test are the most covered, the other two have zero percent coverage.
Since the SafeTest is ran, only code from Safe and classes used by Safe is run.
Therefore some files and packages have zero percent coverage, this is not a problem.
Yes, we added extra checks to the methods testOpenWrongPassword and testActivateWrongPassword
that checked whether the given password is null or empty.

Exercise 2.12
In the first execution the assert statement is ignored and therefore the code runs without any trouble.
In the second execution the assert statement throws an AssertionError.
